# Garbage Classification using EfficientNetV2B2

This project classifies garbage into 6 categories: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash.

## ðŸ”¹ Week 1 Progress:
- Dataset structured and loaded
- Model built with EfficientNetV2B2 using transfer learning
- Training initiated
> ðŸ“¦ Dataset is uploaded as `dataset.zip`. Unzip before running the notebook.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Week 2 Progress:
- Model trained for 15 epochs with EarlyStopping and checkpoint saving
- Accuracy and loss graphs plotted to visualize performance
- Observed class imbalance and overfitting trends for further tuning in Week 3

---

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
- Evaluation with classification report and confusion matrix
- Gradio web interface for real-time garbage classification
